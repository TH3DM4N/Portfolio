# Portfolio
This portfolio will contain all the work that represents my skills.

This Repository consists of multiple types of work:
1. Proof of Concepts
2. Research
3. Applications in development
4. Learning Outcomes S3

## Proof of Concepts
#### 1.DockerTest
This Folder contains a asp.net Core project with a dockerfile, in this project I first got to play around with docker.
#### 2.ReduxTest
This Folder contains a Redux project, I tested some Redux concepts which are later used in the MusicBlend project
#### 3.SpotifyConnectPoC
Since the MusicBlend project uses the SpotifyAPI i needed to test on how to make connection to it. The basis for the MusicBlend Project is made here.
## Research
#### 1.GroupProjectFiles
This folder contains files like an architecture desgin for the MenuApp project
#### 2.MusicBlendFiles
This folder contains files like an architecture desgin for the MusicBlend project
#### 3.Research Documents
This folder contains research done to aquire knowledge about certain topics including security.
## Applications in development
#### 1.MenuApp
This Folder contains a project which is based on a microservice architecture, it is build with a dotnet core backend, ocelot gateway API and multiple React/Redux frontends. This project is made in a group om 6 students in commisioned by the company Mediaan.
#### 2.MusicBlend
This Folder contains a project which is based on a microservice architecture, it is build with a dotnet core backend, ocelot gateway API and a React frontend. This project makes use of SSO and real time communication between users
## Learning Outcomes S3
1. You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.
The proof for this learning outcome can mainly be found in the application files, in the MenuApp and MusicBlend folder are 2 projects located both full-stack with a frontend and backend.
3. You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.
The MusicBlend project is tested and monitored by software called SonarQube, with this software quality of code can be ensured.
5. You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.
The proof for this learning outcome can mainly be found in the application files, in the MenuApp and MusicBlend folder are 2 projects located both having a CI/CD line. The projects contain a docker file and the respositories are build on a push to the master with an github actions file. This file pushes the repository to a docker hub account. The repository on docker hub is ran by an proxy server with the use of a docker-compose file.
7. You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.
The conversations I have with my teacher are the proof of my professional skills and the development I am going through
