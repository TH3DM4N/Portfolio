# Portfolio
This portfolio will contain all the work that represents my skills.

This Repository consists of multiple types of work:
1. Proof of Concepts
2. Research
3. Applications in development

## Proof of Concepts
### 1.DockerTest
This Folder contains a asp.net Core project with a dockerfile, in this project I first got to play around with docker.
### 2.ReduxTest
This Folder contains a Redux project, I tested some Redux concepts which are later used in the MusicBlend project
### 3.SpotifyConnectPoC
Since the MusicBlend project uses the SpotifyAPI i needed to test on how to make connection to it. The basis for the MusicBlend Project is made here.
